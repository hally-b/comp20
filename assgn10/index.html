  <h3><b>API Description and Link</b></h3>
  <p>The link to the API can be found <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">here</a>.</p>
  <p>This API allows you to do multiple different things with meals and recipes.
    The one I chose allows you to get a random recipe and display the important
    information about the recipe such as the name, origin, type, ingredients,
    procedure, and even an image of the meal after it is cooked/baked. </p>
  <p>The option I used for this API was GET. </p>
  <p><i>Two applications for this API:</i></p>
  <ol>
    <li>You could use this API if you were preparing for a cooking competition
      and you wanted to learn how to make a wide variety of dishes. You could
      randomly generate a meal and learn how to make it.</li>
    <li>You could use this API if you wanted to learn about foods eaten
      in certain countries. There is an API that allows you to display recipes
      by country, so you could have it display the recipe and learn more about
      the flavors and methods used for cooking in certain countries which would
      allow you to learn more about culture. </li>
  </ol>
